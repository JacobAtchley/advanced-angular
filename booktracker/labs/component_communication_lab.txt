	1. Add a new property on the existing data service to store the current "Reader of the Month".
  2. Add a method to the data service to set a new "Reader of the Month".
  3. Add a new property to the DashboardComponent to store the "Reader of the Month". Initialize it when the component loads.
  4. Create a new section on the DashboardComponent template to display the "Reader of the Month".
  5. Add a button to the EditReader template that will call a method on the component to set the current reader as the "Reader of the Month" on the data service.
  6. Run the app and verify that changing the current "Reader of the Month" is reflected on the dashboard.


Communicating Using @Input and @Output
--------------------------------------

Add a new "Librarian" property to the InventoryComponent that can be passed in by a parent component. Also, implement a new "Decrease Inventory" feature similar to the existing "Increase Inventory" feature. The parent LibraryComponent should listen for decrease events and update its "totalBookCount" property accordingly.

	1. Add a new property to the InventoryComponent named "branchLibrarian" to store the name of a librarian that may be passed to the component. Update the template to display the librarian name.
  2. Add a new property to the InventoryComponent capable of emitting "decrease" events to parent components.
  3. Add a new method to the InventoryComponent to emit "decrease" events.
  4. Update the InventoryComponent template to include a button that will decrease the number of books.
  5. Add a "branchLibrarian" property to the LibraryComponent and hard-code a value for it.
  6. Write an event handler function in the LibraryComponent to handle "decrease" events.
  7. Update the LibraryComponent template to pass the librarian to the child component and handle decrease events.
  8. Run the app and verify that the new value is passed to the child component and "decrease" events are properly handled.
