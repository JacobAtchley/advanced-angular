Sharing Data with a Service
---------------------------

Implement a new "Reader of the Month" feature similar to the current "Favorite Book" feature.

	1. Add a new property on the existing data service to store the current "Reader of the Month".
  2. Add a method to the data service to set a new "Reader of the Month".
  3. Add a new property to the DashboardComponent to store the "Reader of the Month". Initialize it when the component loads.
  4. Create a new section on the DashboardComponent template to display the "Reader of the Month".
  5. Add a button to the EditReader template that will call a method on the component to set the current reader as the "Reader of the Month" on the data service.
  6. Run the app and verify that changing the current "Reader of the Month" is reflected on the dashboard.
