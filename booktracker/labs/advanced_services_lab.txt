Creating Interceptors Lab
-------------------------

Create an interceptor to log the URL of each HTTP request sent to the server.

  1. Create a new file in the "core" folder named "log-url.interceptor.ts".
  2. Create a class that implements the HttpInterceptor interface and logs to the console the URL of each request made by the app.
  3. Provide the service in "app.module.ts".
  4. Run the app and verify that the URL for the request to retrieve readers (/api/readers) was logged to the browser console.
