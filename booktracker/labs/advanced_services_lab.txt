Providing Services Lab
----------------------

Provide the existing LoggerService in the root app module instead of with the @Injectable decorator
and apply the "useClass" property so that an instance of PlainLogger is injected when a LoggerService
is requested.

  1. Open "logger.service.ts" from the "core" folder.
  2. Remove the @Injectable decorator and the related "import" statement.
  3. Open "app.module.ts" and add the following "providers" array to the "NgModule" decorator.
       providers: [
         { provide: LoggerService, useClass: PlainLoggerService }
       ],
  4. Open "dashboard.component.ts" and inject the LoggerService into the component's constructor.
       private logger: LoggerService
  5. Use the injected service to log a message in the "ngOnInit" method.
       this.logger.log('Dashboard is using PlainLoggerService.');
  6. Run the app and verify that the code works and that the DashboardComponent is using the PlainLoggerService.


Creating Interceptors Lab
-------------------------

Create an interceptor to log the URL of each HTTP request sent to the server.

  1. Create a new file in the "core" folder named "log-url.interceptor.ts".
  2. Add the following code to the file that will log to the browser console the URL of each server request.
        import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";
        import { HttpInterceptor, HttpHandler, HttpRequest, HttpEvent } from "@angular/common/http";
        import { Observable } from "rxjs";

        @Injectable()
        export class LogUrlInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {

          intercept(req: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler): Observable<HttpEvent<any>> {
            
            console.log(req.url);

            return next.handle(req);
          }
        }
  3. Open "app.module.ts" and add the following entry to the "providers" array:
        { provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, useClass: LogUrlInterceptor, multi: true }
  4. Run the app and verify that the the URL for the request to retrieve readers (/api/readers) was logged to the browser console.
