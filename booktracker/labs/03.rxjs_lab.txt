	x 1. Add a new file to the "core" folder that will contain custom operators (if you don't have one already).
	x 2. Export a new operator named "logEagerReaders" that will take a weekly reading goal (in minutes) as a parameter and log the name of readers with a goal greater than that value.
	x 3. Open "data.service.ts" and update the call to "getAllReaders" so that it requests data from the server.
	x 4. Open "dashboard.component.ts" and add a new property to store a Subscription object.
	x 5. Add new code to "ngOnInit" to call "getAllReaders", apply the custom operator, subscribe to the result, and store the returned Subscription.
	x 6. Implement OnDestroy and unsubscribe from the Subscription.
	x 7. Build and run the app.
  x 8. Open the app in a browser to make sure everything still works and the name of the eager readers are logged.
