Workshop Overview Lab
---------------------

The are git tags on the "master" branch of the repo that will reset your code to various points in the workshop.

Any time you checkout a tag and want to begin adding your own code from that point, you should first create a new branch since checking out a tag puts your repo in "detached HEAD" state and any commits you make won't be associated with a branch.

Run the follow commands to set your code files to the workshop starting point and create the branch you'll use for your own code:

  1. Checkout the tag named "workshop_start" that contains the version of the files we'll start with.
       git checkout workshop_start
  2. Create a new branch to contain the code you'll write. Name the branch whatever you like. The following command creates a branch named "my_workshop_code".
       git checkout -b my_workshop_code

If at any point you need to checkout another tag and begin adding your own code from that point, follow these steps again but substitute the tag you need and a different branch name.
