Creating Interceptors Lab
-------------------------

Create an interceptor to log the URL of each HTTP request sent to the server.

  x 1. Create a new file in the "core" folder named "log-url.interceptor.ts".
  x 2. Create a class that implements the HttpInterceptor interface and logs to the console the URL of each request made by the app.
  x 3. Provide the service in "app.module.ts".
  x 4. Run the app and verify that the URL for the request to retrieve readers (/api/readers) was logged to the browser console.
